Ecommerce Website

This project highlights my work, skills, and projects in Python programming and development.  
 
The Ecommerce Website is built using the Flask web framework and showcases my expertise in **Python, web development, and database management**. The frontend is crafted with **HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS**, while the backend leverages **SQLAlchemy ORM** for database operations.  

Key Features: 
âœ… Flask: Backend web framework for managing server-side logic.  
âœ… SQLAlchemy: ORM for seamless database interactions.  
âœ… HTML/css / js: Frontend technologies for creating a responsive and interactive user interface.  

This website allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and proceed with checkout.
